# Description

Geminize is a 2D topdown, pixel-art, adventure/puzzle game where the player
controls a robot in a futuristic world, trying to follow a signal to help his
non-human friend, only to be caught in the stream of a bigger event that was
happening.

The storyline for the game is handcrafted to deliver the developer's vision of
the story, with pre-defined twists and turns. There are also a total of 11
handcrafted maps in the game, each map has its own purpose and identity,
delivering a feeling of a large and complex world where player can freely
explore.

The game's main gameplay loop revolves around 2 main component: the data pieces
and the output template. Each data piece contains some kind of data that the
player can use, either on its own or in combination with other data pieces.
Output template is a special kind of data piece, where a template helps the
player to take control of how the final data is put into shape. To make use of
these two components, the game provides the player with an interface called the
Query Board. Player can add any data to the Query Board, along with an output
template, and these data is piped into Gemini to generate output corresponding
to the output template. This output can either be an hint to guide the player
forward or a key to a blocking point.

The way the puzzle solving system is designed brings the promise of endless
possibilies, where the player can combine any data in any way they think will
work and check the result for any cases.
